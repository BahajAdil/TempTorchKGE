# TempTorchKGE

This repository contains an adaptation of  [TorchKGE](https://torchkge.readthedocs.io) to temporal knowledge graphs. This project was motivated by the lack of efficiency in various implementations of TKG embedding approaches, especially during evaluation.

# Execution

The files main_x.py contain different examples of different models training and evaluation.
